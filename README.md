# IST402

At a minimum, your web page needs to show the following information to the worker:

The plain text of the story (extracted from the web page)
The hyperlink that links to the story web page
The task Instruction
The challenge of the assignment is to design an interface that collects high-quality data from workers. There are no set guidelines on what you need to include in your web page for collecting HITs, but you might consider some of the lessons we've learned in the lecture and from the readings. For instance, how can the interface encourage high-quality responses? How can you make it as difficult to do this job poorly as to do it well? Could you use a gold-standard question for a sanity check? How can you write your instructions clearly? Can you build in some other quality control mechanism? Maybe you can pay them a high amount, or maybe you will bonus them if they agree with others?

We choose SCP Foundation stories to allow you to pay some attention to the weird corner cases of this task, for example:

What is the definition of a "character"? Is "a box that tells you the direction" a character?
What if we don't know the name of a character?
How long should a "short" description be for SCP Foundation stories?
What else information can we collect for a character?
What if the story is confusing?
